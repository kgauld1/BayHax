# BayHax 

BayHax is a stuffed animal toy to track mood changes. BayHax is a handy tool for parents to look after their child's emotional health. This mood tracker is perfect for young children an children with disabilities who have difficulty expressing their emotions.

Inside the BayHax teddy bear is a Raspberry Pi, a Pi Cam, a speaker, and three emoticon buttons that represent happiness, sadness, and anger. Every hour, the teddy bear will ask “How are you feeling?” as a pre-recorded message through the speaker and will prompt the child to press one of the three buttons. The child may also press the buttons at any time, unprompted.

The data from the teddy bear/Raspberry Pi is sent to the BayHax website for the parent to monitor. The website’s dashboard displays the child’s most recent mood while the calendar tracks the child’s mood changes over the period of a day, week, or month. The analytics page offers additional information on the psychology behind a child’s mood, as well as predictions about what time of day the child is the most likely to experience a certain emotion. The monitor page gives you the option to snap a picture to check in on your child when they are napping. There is also a settings page where the parent can adjust the time interval of the teddy’s prompts, the volume of the teddy’s speaker, and whether or not to receive data.

By using BayHax, parents can get a clear picture of their child’s overall emotional health and become better equipped to handle their child’s mood swings. BayHax can also serve as a therapeutic friend for children to confide in.
